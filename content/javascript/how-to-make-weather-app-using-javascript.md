## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a weather app using JavaScript. We'll walk through the process step by step, covering the following:

1. **Setting Up the Project**: Create the basic HTML structure and link your CSS and JavaScript files.
2. **Fetching Weather Data**: Use a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve real-time weather data.
3. **Displaying Data**: Manipulate the DOM to display the weather information dynamically.
4. **Styling the App**: Use CSS to make the app visually appealing and responsive.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for API requests and user inputs.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional weather app that fetches and displays weather data based on user input. This project is perfect for beginners looking to practice JavaScript, API integration, and front-end development.
