## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a full-stack school management app using Next.js. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Setting Up the Project**:
   - Initialize a Next.js project.
   - Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for storing school data.
   - Configure authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
2. **Building the Frontend**:
   - Create role-specific dashboards for admins, teachers, and students.
   - Design a user-friendly interface for managing attendance, grades, schedules, and announcements.
3. **Implementing Backend Functionality**:
   - Set up API routes in Next.js for handling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for students, teachers, courses, and grades.
   - Implement role-based access to restrict features based on user roles (e.g., admins can manage users, teachers can update grades, students can view schedules).
4. **Adding Key Features**:
   - Attendance tracking for students.
   - Grade management for teachers.
   - Announcements and notifications for all users.
5. **Deploying the Application**:
   - Deploy the Next.js app to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
   - Configure the database and environment variables for production.
6. **Enhancing the App**: Add features like report generation, parent portals, or integration with third-party tools like Google Classroom.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional school management app with role-based dashboards, ready for production. This project is perfect for advanced developers looking to explore full-stack development and role-based systems.
