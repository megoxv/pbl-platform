## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build and deploy a Figma clone with real-world features. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Setting Up the Project**:
   - Initialize a Next.js 14 project.
   - Set up Fabric.js for canvas rendering and Liveblocks for real-time collaboration.
2. **Building the Frontend**:
   - Create a responsive and interactive canvas for drawing shapes, uploading images, and designing layouts.
   - Implement a user-friendly interface for tools like shapes, text, and image upload.
3. **Adding Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Enable live cursor tracking and cursor chat for real-time collaboration.
   - Implement comments and reactions on designs for team communication.
4. **Implementing Canvas Features**:
   - Use Fabric.js to handle drawing shapes, adding text, and uploading images.
   - Add functionality for resizing, moving, and editing elements on the canvas.
5. **Deploying the Application**:
   - Deploy the Next.js app to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
   - Configure Liveblocks and other environment variables for production.
6. **Enhancing the App**: Add features like version history, export options (e.g., PNG, PDF), or integration with third-party design tools.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional Figma clone with real-time collaboration features, ready for production. This project is perfect for advanced developers looking to explore real-time collaboration, canvas rendering, and modern web development practices.
