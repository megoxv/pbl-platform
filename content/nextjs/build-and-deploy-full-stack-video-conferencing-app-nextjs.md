## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build and deploy a full stack video conferencing app using Next.js. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Setting Up the Project**:
   - Initialize a Next.js project.
   - Set up WebRTC for real-time video and audio communication.
   - Configure Socket.IO for real-time signaling and room management.
2. **Building the Frontend**:
   - Create a user-friendly interface for joining and managing video calls.
   - Implement features like video toggling, audio muting, and screen sharing.
3. **Implementing Backend Functionality**:
   - Set up API routes in Next.js for handling room creation and user authentication.
   - Use WebRTC to establish peer-to-peer connections for video and audio streaming.
4. **Adding Real-Time Features**:
   - Enable real-time signaling with Socket.IO for room management and user coordination.
   - Implement chat functionality for text-based communication during calls.
5. **Deploying the Application**:
   - Deploy the Next.js app to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
   - Configure WebRTC and Socket.IO for production use.
6. **Enhancing the App**: Add features like recording calls, participant management, or integration with third-party services like calendar APIs.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional video conferencing app with real-time communication features, ready for production. This project is perfect for advanced developers looking to explore real-time communication and fullstack development.
