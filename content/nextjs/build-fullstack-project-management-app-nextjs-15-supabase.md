## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a fullstack project management app using Next.js 15, Supabase, Shadcn, Resend, DnD Kit, and Tiptap. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Setting Up the Project**:
   - Initialize a Next.js 15 project.
   - Set up Supabase for database and authentication.
   - Configure Shadcn for UI components and styling.
2. **Building the Frontend**:
   - Create a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing projects, tasks, and teams.
   - Use DnD Kit for drag-and-drop functionality to organize tasks and boards.
   - Implement Tiptap for rich text editing in task descriptions and comments.
3. **Implementing Backend Functionality**:
   - Set up API routes in Next.js for handling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for projects and tasks.
   - Use Supabase for real-time database updates and user authentication.
4. **Adding Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Enable real-time task updates and notifications using Supabase's real-time capabilities.
   - Implement email notifications using Resend for task assignments and updates.
5. **Deploying the Application**:
   - Deploy the Next.js app to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
   - Configure Supabase, Resend, and other environment variables for production.
6. **Enhancing the App**: Add features like task prioritization, due date reminders, or integration with third-party tools like Slack or Google Calendar.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional project management app with real-time collaboration features, ready for production. This project is perfect for advanced developers looking to explore fullstack development and modern web technologies.
