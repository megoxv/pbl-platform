2. **Building the Frontend**:
   - Create a responsive and user-friendly interface for browsing movies, watching trailers, and managing user profiles.
   - Implement features like video playback, search functionality, and personalized recommendations.
3. **Implementing Backend Functionality**:
   - Set up API routes for handling movie data, user authentication, and video streaming.
   - Use a database to store movie metadata, user information, and watch history.
4. **Adding Key Features**:
   - Enable user authentication for secure login and signup.
   - Implement video streaming functionality for watching trailers and movies.
   - Add features like watchlists, ratings, and user profiles.
5. **Deploying the Application**:
   - Deploy the Flutter app to a platform like Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
   - Configure the backend for production use.
6. **Enhancing the App**: Add features like push notifications, offline viewing, or integration with third-party services.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional Netflix clone with video streaming, user authentication, and a responsive UI, ready for production. This project is perfect for intermediate developers looking to explore full-stack development and video streaming applications.
