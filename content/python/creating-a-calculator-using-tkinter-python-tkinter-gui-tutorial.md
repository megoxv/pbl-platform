## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a calculator using Python's Tkinter library. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Setting Up the Project**: Import the Tkinter library and set up the basic window for the calculator.
2. **Designing the Calculator Interface**:
   - Create buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /).
   - Add a display screen to show the input and results.
3. **Adding Functionality**:
   - Implement event handling for button clicks.
   - Write logic to perform basic arithmetic operations.
   - Handle edge cases like division by zero or invalid inputs.
4. **Enhancing the Calculator**: Add advanced features like a clear button, backspace functionality, or support for decimal numbers.
5. **Running the Application**: Test the calculator and ensure it works as expected.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional calculator built with Python and Tkinter. This project is perfect for beginners looking to explore GUI development and event-driven programming in Python.
