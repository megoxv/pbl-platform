## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Setting Up the Project**: Install Pygame and set up the basic game window.
2. **Designing the Game**:
   - Create the snake and food objects.
   - Set up the game grid and initialize the game state.
3. **Implementing Game Logic**:
   - Handle snake movement using arrow keys.
   - Detect collisions with food, walls, and the snake itself.
   - Increase the snake's length when it eats food.
4. **Adding Game Features**:
   - Display the score and update it as the snake eats food.
   - Add game-over logic and a restart option.
5. **Enhancing the Game**: Add features like levels, speed increases, or sound effects to make the game more engaging.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional Snake Game built with Python and Pygame. This project is perfect for beginners looking to explore game development and understand basic game mechanics.
