## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build an Image to PDF Converter application using Python. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Setting Up the Project**: Import necessary libraries like Tkinter for the GUI, PIL/Pillow for image processing, and FPDF for PDF generation.
2. **Designing the User Interface**:
   - Create a simple and intuitive GUI with buttons to upload images and convert them to PDF.
   - Add a display area to show selected images.
3. **Implementing Image to PDF Conversion**:
   - Write logic to handle multiple image uploads.
   - Convert the uploaded images into a single PDF file.
4. **Adding Functionality**:
   - Allow users to reorder or remove images before conversion.
   - Save the generated PDF to a user-specified location.
5. **Enhancing the App**: Add features like image compression, PDF customization (e.g., page size, margins), or support for additional image formats.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional Image to PDF Converter application built with Python. This project is perfect for intermediate developers looking to explore GUI development, image processing, and file handling in Python.
